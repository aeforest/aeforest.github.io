									<h3>GMT Corporation</h3>
									<p>At GMT Corporation, I got my real experience in a professional work envirenment.  I did not do any software development work, but my job did require a lot of professional communication.  Throughout the summer, I documented several processes in the company and created reports that were used to analyze the efficiency of these processes as well as train new employees.</p>

									<p>At Principal Financial Group, I got my first technical work experience.  I worked as an application development intern primarily using Java.  I was on an agile scrum team and most of the work that I did throughout the summer was maintaining and updating a legacy system.  Lerning to be able to read code that others wrote and understand it well enough to update it was a very interesting experience.  That is not something we do very often in our classes.</p>

									<h3>Roguelike Game - CS 229</h3>
									<p>The main component of CS 229 was a semester-long individual project in C and C++.  I developed a roguelike game by implementing a new component each week.  Tasks at the beginning consisted of things like generating a random map with a certain number of rooms and tunnels that connect them all.  Towards the end, I wrote code to simulate different types of monsters that would spawn into the game and have different stats.</p>

									<h3>Censure - CS 309</h3>
									<p>CS 309 was a semester-long project.  I worked on a team of 4 members.  I worked primarily on our MySQL database and writing PHP code.  For this project, we created a web application.  This application allowed users to login to their social media websites such as Twitter and Facebook and then scan through their past posts.  Our app would scan for swearing or other potetially unprofessional posts and show these posts to the user.  The user could then decide if they wanted to delete those posts or not.</p>

									<h3>Lexer Language - CS 319</h3>
									<p>In CS 319, we had several portfolio projects throughout the semester that we completed in groups of 2.  Since there were only 2 people, we did not think specific team roles were neccessary, so we made sure to communicate frequently to ensure that everything got done.  For the final portfolio, my partner and I created a programming language using ANTLR.  Our language was capable of handling boolean and numerical variables, if/else statements, and method calls.  This also required some Java coding and the Java BeanShell library.</p>

									<h3>Accu-Pop - SE 491 (Senior Design)</h3>
									<p>Just this semester, Spring 2016, I started on my senior design project.  I the team leader for our team of 6 students.  We are currently still in the planning and initial experimentation phase.  We will be creating a device for catchers and second basemen to wear during a baseball scouting event.  This device will be used to measure the catcher's pop-time, which is the amount of time it takes for the catcher to get the ball to the second basemen after he catches the pitch.</p>

						<h2>General Education Reflection</h2>
					</header>
					<article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">GE1. What are your current short term (within next one or two years) and long term (next five to ten years) goals? You may include your ideal career in engineering or your preferred working environment.</h3>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">As I am approaching graduation, I have come up with a few goals that I would like to accomplish in the near future.  Obviously, one of those goals is to find a great job.  Before I can do that however, I have to figure our what a great job even looks like.  To help figure that out, I've had internships and talked to people with careers at various companies.  I still have a lot to figure out, but I have learned a few things so far.</p>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">One of the easiest is location.  I know many people who have big plans to get as far away from the state of Iowa as fast as possible once they graduate.  I however would like to stay.  I've worked in Des Moines for a summer, and I'll be working in Ames this summer, and I learned that anyone who thinks the only good jobs are on a coast is wrong.</p>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">I have also learned that different companies have different cultures, and finding an enjoyable culture is very important.  So far, I've found that other people I've talked to feel more motivated when working in an innovative and competitive environment.  I can see myself enjoying that type of culture as well.</p>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">In addition to starting my career shortly after graduation, I have some long term goals.  Once I find the right company for me, I would really like to stay at that company long-term and get to know what they do.  I have noticed that it is easy to fall into a routine at work where I focus only on my job and ignore everything going on around me.  I think it would be much more enjoyable if I took the time to see what other things are happening at the company and how my work fits into the big picture.</p>
				  </article>
				  <article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">GE2.	What have you learned in your general education electives that allow you to evaluate and formulate engineering solutions with problem solving and innovation beyond the technical aspects in problem solving? How do general education classes help you to think about an engineering problem?</h3>
  				  <p style="font-size:120%">I think that the main skill I refined through my general education courses was communication, which is very important.  An engineer must be able to communicate the technical plans and progress of their work, and I believe that Iowa State has prepared me to do that.</p>
  				  <p style="font-size:120%">I have also worked towards a minor in mathematics, which I find to be very helpful when solving technical problems.  I find myself using math when trying to figure out which algorithm will be more efficient for a programming project, or other things like that.  I also think that my math background helps make the complex topics in my upper level computer science and software engineering courses easier to understand.
  				</article>
  				<article class="box style2">
					  <h3 style="text-align:left">GE3.	Describe specific instances where you used knowledge/skills from general elective courses for innovation in engineering problems. What impact does meshing technical engineering skills and general electives-based innovation have in an economic, global, or societal context?</h3>
					  <p style="font-size:120%">Anytime I work on a team project, I am meshing my technical skills and my general skills.  If everyone on the team had great technical skills but couldn't communicate effectively, the project would probably not progress very efficiently.  There would be situations where 2 people did the same work, or maybe 2 people would have different, clashing ideas about how to solve the same problem.  Communication is necessary for a team to operate smoothly.</p>
					  <p style="font-size:120%">As the team leader for my senior design project, I have a responsibility to communicate with my team, our stakeholders, and our advisor to make sure we are progressing at an acceptable speed and doing quality work.</p>

						<h2>Cumulative Reflection</h2>
					</header>
					<article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">CR1.	How do you think ISU has prepared you to: a.	Design systems or processes? b.	Formulate and solve engineering problems? c.	Impact engineering solutions in a global/societal context?</h3>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">The coursework I have done at Iowa State has prepared me to design systems and precesses, formulate and solve engineering problems and impact engineerings soluctions in a global/societal context.  I have done all of these things in my classes through the projects and assignments that I have completed.  I have also had internship opportunities because of my ISU education where I have learned and practiced these tasks as well.</p>
				  </article>
					<article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">CR2.	What things have you done at ISU to prepare you to: a.	Work in groups? b.	Recognize contemporary issues? c.	Understand professional and ethical responsibilities?</h3>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">As a student at Iowa State, I have worked in groups in both general education classes and technical classes.  This has helped me to learn how to work in a group with diverse members.  For example, a group I was in for an English class included myself, an agricultural engineering student, and a business student.</p>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">I have also encountered issues throughout my four years of school.  Through those experiences, I have learned how to recognize and avoid those problems as much as possible.  I have also learned to solve them when they inevitably occur again.</p>
				  </article>
					<article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">CR3.	In class projects & problem solving tasks, did you draw upon information, research, or experiences beyond what was provided in class to successfully complete your work? Please state which resources you used here and how they helped you to complete work (e.g. library resources, specific professional journals, experts in field, other students).</h3>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">Iowa State University provides all of the resources a student could possibly need to succeed, so I have made sure to take advantage of those resources when necessary.  Professors and TAs have office hours, they often post internet links to useful resources on the course websites, and the library has plenty of other resources.  I have also worked with fellow classmates to help each other when appropriate.</p>
				  </article>
					<article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">CR4.	How did learning activities outside of the classroom (required 124.5 credits)  such as Student Orgs, Career or Study Abroad Fairs, Undergraduate Research Experience (REU), or other university programs  help you to understand the importance of Lifelong Learning?</h3>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">I have had internships every summer in college and everyone I have worked with at those companies has stressed the importance of lifelong learning.  Software in particular is a field that is constantly changing.  New tools and technologies are being created and old tech is becoming obsolete very rapidly.  In order to keep up with this, I must continue learning for the rest of my life.</p>
				  </article>
					<article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">CR5.	Have you started to undertake any new learning to improve your ability to apply skills or knowledge to new problems and to develop confidence in taking risks? Please explain.</h3>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">I think that the best way to do this is to practice, which I have done.  Throughout my classes and my internships, I have gained experience in this aspect.  Real world problems are all about applying old skills and knowledge to new situations, so I have tried my best to do that whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
				  </article>
					<article class="box style2">
  					<h3 style="text-align:left">CR6.	In the context of the first four questions, if you were to do your undergraduate work again, what things would you change?</h3>
  					<p style="font-size:120%">One thing I wish I had done is to pick a more specific field to go deeper into.  Software Engineering is a very broad field with many different career or further education paths to choose from.  I waited until this semester to do a lot of my technical electives, and now I am at the point where I don't have a lot of flexibility in my schedule to choose which electives I want to take.  If I had looked into this earlier and started finding technical electives that looked especially interesting, I might have been able to have more input into what I took.</p>
